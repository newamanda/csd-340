    <p class="intro">Hello World! My name is Amanda New. I am 28 years old and from Dallas, GA.
        I haven't moved too far from there, so I have been here all my life. We recently had some snow days
        which were super fun! I have listed some more information about me. I hope you have a great day!
    </p>
    <p>My immediate family includes me, my brother, my mom and my dad. In my family, both of my parents have re-married, 
        and so I gained a couple additional siblings- one step brother and a step sister- and my step mom (all of whom I loved dearly). 
        <span class="sentence"> My extended family is huge, so I'll spare you the details of going into that.</span> </p>
    <p>In my free time, I'm both a bit nerdy, and have an inner grandma idea of fun. I play a lot of video games (all kinds- lately it's mostly Stardew Valley).
        I also love to crochet; I do a style called mosaic crochet, which is a bit more challenging but a lot more fun! I also make little stuffed animals
        from time-to-time, my most recent being a little penguin for my boyfriend for Christmas. Other than those, I'm either reading or running
        (I know- a real party animal!)</p>
    <p>Going through this degree program has been both difficult and rewarding. I remember when I first started working in VSCode and how overwhelming everything
        felt (and still does sometimes), but I am excited for the future that taking this path will lead me. I am looking forward to graduating next year, 
        starting my job search, and hopefully being able to use this skillset that I'm building to work at companies with good employee values- 
        it's all about the benefits! I just want to find something that I enjoy- be happy with what you have while working for what you want! 
    </p>
